# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Maintainers move entries out of `Unreleased` into a new versioned section
immediately before tagging a release (see the release process in `README.md`).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `IRozetkaPayWebhookSignatureVerifier` and `RozetkaPayWebhookSignatureVerifier` in
  `SYT.RozetkaPay.Security`, verifying the `X-ROZETKAPAY-SIGNATURE` header on incoming
  callbacks against the raw request body. Registered as a singleton by `AddRozetkaPay`.
  Missing, malformed, and incorrect signatures return `false` instead of throwing, and
  digests are compared in constant time.
- Tag-based [MinVer](https://github.com/adamralph/minver) versioning; the package
  version is derived from the `v*.*.*` release tag instead of a hardcoded value.
- Pull request build, test, and package verification (`Build & Test` workflow).
- Tag-triggered NuGet publishing and GitHub Releases (`Release NuGet` workflow).

### Changed
- A push to `main` no longer publishes a NuGet package; publishing now happens
  only when a version tag is pushed.

### Fixed
- NuGet README maintainer image rendering.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-02-28
